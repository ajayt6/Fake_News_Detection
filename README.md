# Chrome extension for Fake news detection

Fake news is becoming a major negative influence on society and politics, especially in the recent past. It is threatenging the very foundations of democracy. We are proposing a solution to this. Our product aims to be a digital helper that arms the user with more information so that he/she can decide whether a given news item is factually true or fake.

To this end, we have developed a chrome extension that reports whether news article on the webpage is 'true', 'fake' or 'unsure'.

We hope this will benefit the internet community out there by empowering them with assistance for detection fake news.
